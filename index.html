            <p>Hey! I’m <b>Trishal Muthan</b>. I’m a 4th-year computer science major at <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science" >University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>. 
                I’m passionate about software development and I'm looking to make an impact and get more involved in the software engineering, machine learning, and cloud space.</p>
            
            <p>This summer, I’m interning at <a href="https://www.bti360.com/">BTI360</a> in Herndon, VA, where I'm building a custom knowledge graph to reveal intricate real-world relationships.</p>
            
            <p>Last summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.idirect.net/">ST Engineering iDirect</a> in Herndon, VA.  
                While there, I worked on the development of the company’s cloud and on-premise infrastructure management tools. 
                Specifically, I added features that extracted critical data from servers and displayed that information to a UI. 
                Additionally, I worked on the deployment and configuration of those infrastructure tools.</p>
            
            <p>At the University of Virginia, I’ve taken a variety of advanced coursework including Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems and Organization, Discrete Mathematics, Software Engineering, Probability, and Linear Algebra. 
                I’ve also served as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.gerlingtouchlab.com/">Touch Lab</a>, where I designed and implemented machine learning models to classify neuron recordings by emotion. 
                Additionally, I’m involved in many student organizations. I stay active in the Association for Computing Machinery, Machine Learning Club, and Indian Student Association, 
                and I’m currently the recruitment chair and scholarship chair for the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. </p>
            
            <p> I graduated from <a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> in 2022. 
                There, I worked on a real-time vehicle classification system using convolution neural networks, 
                a facial recognition software that alerts cognitively impaired users whether recorded individuals are known or unknown to them, 
                and an analysis of the algorithmic fairness of various types of machine learning models. I was also a teaching assistant for the school's precalculus course.</p>
            
            <p> I’m located in Charlottesville, VA while I’m at school and in Centreville, VA when I’m at home. 
                I enjoy <a href="https://letterboxd.com/trishalmuthan/">watching films</a> (favorite at the moment is Past Lives!), reading, listening to music, staying active, and being outdoors.
                Please feel free to reach out! </p>
