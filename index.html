            <p> Hi, I’m <b>Trey</b>! Currently, I’m living in the Northern Virginia/DC area and 
                working as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.bti360.com/">BTI360</a>. 
                I recently graduated in May 2025 with a bachelor’s in computer science (BSCS) from the 
                <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science" >University of Virginia’s 
                    School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>.
            </p>

            <p> Over the past few years, I’ve gotten the opportunity to get a lot of experience 
                in the software engineering, machine learning, and cloud spaces. During the summer 
                of 2024, I interned at <a href="https://www.bti360.com/">BTI360</a>, where I built 
                a custom knowledge graph to reveal intricate real-world relationships. In the summer 
                of 2023, I interned at <a href="https://www.idirect.net/">ST Engineering iDirect</a> 
                where I developed cloud and on-premise infrastructure management tools.
            </p>
            
            <p> While at the University of Virginia, I took a variety of advanced coursework including 
                Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, 
                Database Systems, Computer Networks, Cybersecurity, Probability, Linear Algebra, and much 
                more. I also worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.gerlingtouchlab.com/">Touch Lab</a>, 
                where I designed and implemented machine learning models to classify neuron recordings by 
                emotion. Additionally, I was involved in many student organizations such as the Association for 
                Computing Machinery, Machine Learning Club, and Indian Student Association. I also served as 
                the recruitment chair and scholarship chair for the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
            </p>
            
            <p> I graduated from <a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science 
                and Technology</a> in 2022. There, I worked on a real-time vehicle classification system 
                using convolution neural networks, a facial recognition software that alerts cognitively 
                impaired users whether recorded individuals are known or unknown to them, and an analysis 
                of the algorithmic fairness of various types of machine learning models. I was also a teaching 
                assistant for the school's precalculus course.
            </p>
            
            <p> Outside of work, I enjoy <a href="https://letterboxd.com/trishalmuthan/">watching films</a> 
                (my all time favorite is La La Land!), reading, listening to music, staying active, and being 
                outdoors. Please feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate!
            </p>
