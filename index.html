    <h1>Trishal Muthan</h1>
    <p>Hey! I’m Trishal Muthan. I’m a 3rd-year computer science major at University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 
        I’m passionate about software development and have experience with a variety of technologies. 
        I’m eager to make an impact and get more involved in the software engineering, cloud, and machine learning space.</p>
    <p>This upcoming summer I’m going to be interning at BTI360 in Herndon, VA.</p>
    <p>Last summer, I interned at ST Engineering iDirect in Herndon, VA.  
        While there, I worked on the development of the company’s hardware infrastructure management and monitoring tool. 
        Specifically, I added features that extracted data from the company’s hardware and displayed that information to a UI. 
        Additionally, I worked on the deployment and configuration of that infrastructure tool.</p>
    <p>At the University of Virginia, I’ve taken a variety of advanced coursework including Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Systems and Organization, Discrete Mathematics, Software Development Essentials, Probability, and Linear Algebra. 
        I’ve also served as a research assistant in the Touch Lab, where I designed and implemented machine learning models to classify neuron recordings by emotion. 
        Additionally, I’m involved in many student organizations. I am active in the Association for Computing Machinery, Machine Learning Club, and Indian Student Association, 
        and I’ve served as the academic chair of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. </p>
    <p> I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2022. 
        There, I worked on a real-time vehicle classification system using convolution neural networks, 
        a facial recognition software that alerts cognitively impaired users whether recorded individuals are known or unknown to them, 
        and an analysis of the algorithmic fairness of various common machine learning models. </p>
    <p> I’m located in Charlottesville, VA while I’m at school and in Chantilly, VA when I’m at home. 
        I enjoy watching and making films (my favorite at the moment is Past Lives), reading, listening to music, being active, and being outdoors.
        Please feel free to reach out! </p>
