    <section id="content">
    <p>Hey! I’m <b>Trishal Muthan</b>. I’m a 3rd-year computer science major at <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science" >University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>. 
        I’m passionate about software development and have experience with a variety of technologies. 
        I’m eager to make an impact and get more involved in the software engineering, cloud, and machine learning space.</p>
    <p>This upcoming summer I’m going to be interning at <a href="https://www.bti360.com/">BTI360</a> in Herndon, VA.</p>
    <p>Last summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.idirect.net/">ST Engineering iDirect</a> in Herndon, VA.  
        While there, I worked on the development of the company’s hardware infrastructure management and monitoring tool. 
        Specifically, I added features that extracted data from the company’s hardware and displayed that information to a UI. 
        Additionally, I worked on the deployment and configuration of that infrastructure tool.</p>
    <p>At the University of Virginia, I’ve taken a variety of advanced coursework including Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Systems and Organization, Discrete Mathematics, Software Development Essentials, Probability, and Linear Algebra. 
        I’ve also served as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.gerlingtouchlab.com/">Touch Lab</a>, where I designed and implemented machine learning models to classify neuron recordings by emotion. 
        Additionally, I’m involved in many student organizations. I am active in the Association for Computing Machinery, Machine Learning Club, and Indian Student Association, 
        and I’ve served as the academic chair of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. </p>
    <p> I graduated from <a href="https://tjhsst.fcps.edu/">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> in 2022. 
        There, I worked on a real-time vehicle classification system using convolution neural networks, 
        a facial recognition software that alerts cognitively impaired users whether recorded individuals are known or unknown to them, 
        and an analysis of the algorithmic fairness of various common machine learning models. </p>
    <p> I’m located in Charlottesville, VA while I’m at school and in Chantilly, VA when I’m at home. 
        I enjoy <a href="https://letterboxd.com/trishalmuthan/">watching and making films</a> (favorite at the moment is Past Lives!), reading, listening to music, being active, and being outdoors.
        Please feel free to reach out! </p>
